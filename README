dutchie's irssi scripts

No guarantee of working, if they break everything/make you look like an idiot

poke me about them there :)
 
Two (so far):
digraphs.pl
- allow entry of Unicode characters Ã  la Vim with Ctrl-K

irssi_give_talk.pl:
- irssi port of Stuart Langridge's IRC talk script
- http://kryogenix.org/days/2009/08/31/delivering-talks-by-irc-an-xchat-plugin
